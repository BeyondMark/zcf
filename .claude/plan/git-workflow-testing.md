# Git Workflow Testing Plan

## Context
Adding comprehensive tests for the new Git workflow feature (gitWorkflow) that includes staging area operations.

## Objective
Ensure the Git workflow functionality is properly tested with >90% coverage.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Tests
1. **workflows.test.ts** - Test workflow configuration management
   - Test getWorkflowConfig() for gitWorkflow
   - Test getOrderedWorkflows() includes new workflow
   - Validate configuration structure

2. **workflow-installer.test.ts** - Test installation logic
   - Test Git workflow installation
   - Test command file copying
   - Test cleanup of old files
   - Validate installation results

### Phase 2: Edge Cases
3. **workflows.edge.test.ts** - Boundary conditions
   - File system errors
   - Missing templates
   - Permission issues
   - Concurrent operations

### Phase 3: Integration
4. **Integration tests** - End-to-end workflow
   - Complete installation flow
   - User interaction simulation
   - Configuration updates
